# DayZ-Samples
This Repository aims to provide the DayZ modding community with samples for a wide variety of use cases. 

In this repo you will find a variety of samples from the basic creation of your first mod to more advanced scripting topics and everything in between. 
Keep in mind that at the current moment I am the only person working on this, so updates come when I have time.

Use the wiki provided to learn about the samples.

Please !!! If you know a better way to do something contribute !!! These samples will hopefully help new modders get started and help the community as a whole.
